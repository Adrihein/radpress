Radpress is a simple blog application for Djangonauts. It doesn't use a WYSIWYG
editor; the default markup syntax is `reStructuredText`_ and you can preview
your entry simply before publishing it. Radpress now ships with a `Markdown`_
renderer, too!

Radpress' default theme is based on `Author theme`_ by Mike McAlister. Thank
you for the support.
